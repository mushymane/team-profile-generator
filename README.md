# Team Profile Generator

## Description 

This command line app generates an HTML page that displays members of your team. Each member is an 
instance of a Manager class, an Engineer class, or an Intern class. The user will be asked questions about 
their team members and the information get saved into an HTML in the dist folder. The dist folder also 
has an accompanying CSS file for slight styling.

It uses the npm Inquirer package to ask questions and receive input. It also uses the Node File System module 
to write that data to a file. For testing, Jest provides the framework. There is a file called 
generateHTML.js which generates the entire HTML file using the user's input and template literals. The cards are 
color-coded for each type of member. When a user visits the page, they can click on the email to open their 
default email program and populates the TO field. The user may also click on an Engineer's Github profile link.

NOTE: if you get this project from Github, 'roster.html' will be overriden with your new input. It is only present 
here for demonstrative purposes. Also 'index.html' is unused.
